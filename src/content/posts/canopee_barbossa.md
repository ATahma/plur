Centered on consistent, seamless mixing, thundering visuals, lush decorations, and dance floor heaters until close, we’re prepared to make Friday, October 17 at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/barbossa.mtl/">@barbossa.mtl</a> an awe-striking night for the history books.

To start things off, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/xoxoxo.dawny/">@xoxoxo.dawny</a> will ignite the flame, and to keep the fire roaring, we’re welcoming some of Montreals finest selectors, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/j.bhd_/"> @j.bhd_ >/a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/miasalav/">@miasalav</a> for a 3 hour b2b aimed at unveiling each other’s most mind boggling tracks. You’ll want to capture every second, and expect a multitude of genres being explored from punchy breaks, jungle, bass, techno, electro, and experimental.

Cover will be 6$ at the door, and you can dm for guestlist. Half priced cocktails until 10pm to get your night started on the right note.

Can’t wait to see you there!🦜🌱🍀🌷
